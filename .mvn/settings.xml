  <!-- profiles
   | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways,
   | and which can modify the build process. Profiles provided in the
   | settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-specific paths and
   | repository locations which allow the build to work in the local
   | environment.
   |
   | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus -
   | that needs to know where your Tomcat instance is installed, you can
   | provide a variable here such that the variable is dereferenced during the
   | build process to configure the cactus plugin.
   |
   | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One
   | way - the activeProfiles section of this document (settings.xml) - will be
   | discussed later. Another way essentially relies on the detection of a
   | system property, either matching a particular value for the property, or
   | merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK
   | version prefix, where a value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the
   | build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'. Finally, the list of
   | active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.
   |
   | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to
   |       specifying only artifact repositories, plugin repositories, and
   |       free-form properties to be used as configuration variables for
   |       plugins in the POM.

  <profiles>
    <!-- profile
     | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated
     | using one or more of the mechanisms described above. For inheritance
     | purposes, and to activate profiles via <activatedProfiles/> or the
     | command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.
     |
     | An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a
     | consistent naming convention for profiles, such as 'env-dev',
     | 'env-test', 'env-production', 'user-jdcasey', 'user-brett', etc. This
     | will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced
     | profiles is attempting to accomplish, particularly when you only have a
     | list of profile id's for debug.
     |
     | This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and
     | provides a JDK-specific repo.

    <!--
     | Here is another profile, activated by the system property 'target-env'
     | with a value of 'dev', which provides a specific path to the Tomcat
     | instance. To use this, your plugin configuration might hypothetically
     | look like:
     |
     | ...
     | <plugin>
     |   <groupId>org.myco.myplugins</groupId>
     |   <artifactId>myplugin</artifactId>
     |
     |   <configuration>
     |     <tomcatLocation>${tomcatPath}</tomcatLocation>
     |   </configuration>
     | </plugin>
     | ...
     |
     | NOTE: If you just wanted to inject this configuration whenever someone
     |       set 'target-env' to anything, you could just leave off the
     |       <value/> inside the activation-property.
