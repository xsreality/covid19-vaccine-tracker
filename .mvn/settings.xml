    <!-- profiles
     | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways,
     | and which can modify the build process. Profiles provided in the
     | settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-specific paths and
     | repository locations which allow the build to work in the local
     | environment.
     |
     | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus -
     | that needs to know where your Tomcat instance is installed, you can
     | provide a variable here such that the variable is dereferenced during the
     | build process to configure the cactus plugin.
     |
     | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One
     | way - the activeProfiles section of this document (settings.xml) - will be
     | discussed later. Another way essentially relies on the detection of a
     | system property, either matching a particular value for the property, or
     | merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK
     | version prefix, where a value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the
     | build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'. Finally, the list of
     | active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.
     |
     | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to
     |       specifying only artifact repositories, plugin repositories, and
     |       free-form properties to be used as configuration variables for
     |       plugins in the POM.

    <mirrors>
        <!-- mirror
         | Specifies a repository mirror site to use instead of a given repository.
         | The repository that this mirror serves has an ID that matches the
         | mirrorOf element of this mirror. IDs are used for inheritance and direct
         | lookup purposes, and must be unique across the set of mirrors.

          <id>confluent</id>
          <mirrorOf>confluent</mirrorOf>

    <profiles>
        <!-- profile
         | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated
         | using one or more of the mechanisms described above. For inheritance
         | purposes, and to activate profiles via <activatedProfiles/> or the
         | command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.
         |
         | An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a
         | consistent naming convention for profiles, such as 'env-dev',
         | 'env-test', 'env-production', 'user-jdcasey', 'user-brett', etc. This
         | will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced
         | profiles is attempting to accomplish, particularly when you only have a
         | list of profile id's for debug.
         |
         | This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and
         | provides a JDK-specific repo.

        <!--
         | Here is another profile, activated by the system property 'target-env'
         | with a value of 'dev', which provides a specific path to the Tomcat
         | instance. To use this, your plugin configuration might hypothetically
         | look like:
         |
         | ...
         | <plugin>
         |   <groupId>org.myco.myplugins</groupId>
         |   <artifactId>myplugin</artifactId>
         |
         |   <configuration>
         |     <tomcatLocation>${tomcatPath}</tomcatLocation>
         |   </configuration>
         | </plugin>
         | ...
         |
         | NOTE: If you just wanted to inject this configuration whenever someone
         |       set 'target-env' to anything, you could just leave off the
         |       <value/> inside the activation-property.
