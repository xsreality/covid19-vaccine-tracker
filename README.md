This repository stores the source code of the Telegram Bot CoWIN Alerts available at https://t.me/covid19_vaccine_tracker_bot

## Features

* Send up to 5 pincodes for updates.
* Set your preferred age, dose and vaccine for alerts.
* Bot checks against CoWIN API every 5 minutes.
* Streaming pipeline to notify as soon as slots open.

### Design Goals
* Send notifications as soon as new Vaccination slots are available.
* Store critical data (like user requests) in Kafka to achieve RPO = 0
* Store non-critical data (like Vaccine slots which can be recovered from CoWIN API)
 outside Kafka to keep costs low.
